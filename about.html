          <p>
              I am a second-year student at the University of Michigan's School of Information UX Research and Design master's program. My background in hospitality at Boston University has taught me customer service by developing interpersonal skills and attention to detail. I also minored in computer science, which allows me to understand the backend of technology. These transferable skills apply to UX design since UX focuses on the userâ€™s positive experience.
          </p>   
          <p>
              My goal as a UX designer is to incorporate awareness and mindfulness when creating an inclusive and accessible user experience that makes an impact on the world and connects on a deep level with the users.
          </p>
          <h2>Hobbies</h2>

          <p>In my leisure time, I enjoy travel, photography, and designing cards and posters. I love the idea of including personal touch and connecting with humans intimately. This is also part of the reason why I love user experience; the idea that micro-interactions and empathy that could talk directly to a human's heart. Below I have showcased a couple of artworks and moments that I have captured.</p>
